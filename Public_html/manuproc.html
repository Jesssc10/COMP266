            <h2>Fusion Glass</h2>
            <p> The manufacturing of this high-performance glass is strictly carried out through automated systems attached to a network and controlled by computers. THe raw material are combined which includes sand and other non-organic materials. These materials are then combimed in a large melting tank and heated to 1, 000 degress and beyond. The molten glass is then mixed and conditioned to ensure uniformity. Once completed, this molten mixture is then released into a large collection channel that incorporates a V-shpaed bottom, known as a isopipe. The liquid glass flows out of the top of the isopipe evenly coating both sides of it and creating two stream of glass like surfaces. These two streams them meat at the bottom of the isopipe, "fusing," them into a single sheet of pirstine glass.This sheet is then fed into drawing equipment as it begins to lengthen and cool. Once the glass has cooled and near the bottom of the drawing equipment it is then cut and packaged for processing. This fusion technique saves time and money by not requiring the glass to be polished after completion that is required with the traditional glass manufacturing process. </p>

            <h2>1: Mixing:</h2>
            <p>The first step in the automation process involves the mixing. The raw materials are weighted and then mixed in vat above the furnace. From the mixer, the raw materials are then transported to a conveyer belt via a robot like the Robotworx Motoman UP20-6 (Left). The conveyer belt then takes the raw materials to the furnace for the “hot end” process.</p>
            <h2>2: Heating</h2>
            <p>The next step, which is sometimes referred to as the “hot end” process begins. The molten glass is slowly and diligently fed into the furnace which can be anywhere from 2300 degrees Celsius and up. Once through the furnace, the glass is refined and cooled to the desired temperature.</p>
            <h2>3: Forming</h2>
            <p>Once cooled to the desired temperature, it is then sent to the bottom of the feeder where an electronically controlled plunger cuts the glass to its desired specifications as it leaves the feeder. From the feeder the glass is sprayed with alternating hot and cold solutions to relieve stress. These applications are performed by robots such as the Robotworx, Fanuc M-170iC/70T (Left).</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>4: Packaging</h2>
            <p>The last step of glass automation process is its packaging. When packaging glass bottles, robots like the Robotworx Fanuc M-420iA (Left) are used to place bottles in cartons; Palletizing robots, like the Robotworx Motoman UP165 (Right), are used to place those cartons on pallets.</p>

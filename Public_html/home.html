            <h2>Computer-Managed Glass Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>The computer-managed manufacturing process of glass is a steam lined operation which incorporates machines to achieve precision, uniformity, and quality. Let’s face it, humans make mistakes; however, our vast amounts of knowledge in this technological age allow us to create machines that can do it better than us – robots! There are a few different companies that make robots for the various automated glass manufacturers, such as Genesis-Systems based out of Davenport, IA and Robotworx, out of Marion, OH. These companies produce their own robots, however an industry standard 4 step process is widely adhered to. Make sure to check out these 4 steps as well as a specialized process that Corning Inc has developed in the creation of high-tech LCD and smartphone screens, named Fusion Glass!  </p>
